# Game of Life
### This project contains code for Conway's Game of Life code Kata.
#### Rules of the game:
 * the Game of Life is an infinete two-dimensional grid of square cells
 * each cell can be alive or dead
 * every cell interacts with its eight neighbors either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
 * give an initial pattern or seed for the system to run on
 * the first generation is created by applying the following rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed
      - births and deaths occur simultaneously
 *  Generation Transition Rules:
      1. Any live cell with < 2 live neighbors dies, due to underpopulation
      2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives to the next generation
      3. Any live cell with > 3 live neighbors dies, due to overpopulation
      4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, due to reproduction
