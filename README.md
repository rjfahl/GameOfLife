# Game of Life
### This project contains code for Conway's Game of Life, TDD driven, code Kata.
#### Rules of the game:
 * The Game of Life is an infinete two-dimensional grid of square cells
      - each cell being alive or dead
 * Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
 * An initial pattern or seed should be given to the game
 * The first generation is created by applying the following rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed
 *  Generation Transition Rules:
      1. Any live cell with < 2 live neighbors dies, due to underpopulation
      2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives to the next generation
      3. Any live cell with > 3 live neighbors dies, due to overpopulation
      4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, due to reproduction
